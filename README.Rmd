# isit

[![CRAN status](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/isit)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=isit)

## Overview

isit contains predicate functions - functions that return TRUE or FALSE -
that I use across my own packages. This package is very simple and probably
not very useful to the generel public (yet)


## Installation

```
# You can also install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("s-fleck/isit")
```
